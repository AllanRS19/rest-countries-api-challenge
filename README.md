## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) - Build Tool and Development Server
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS Library For UI
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - Utility-first CSS Framework
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/home) - Router for React
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to follow a Mobile-first workflow to design responsive UIs. Additionally, I was able to resolve a few issues related to positioning elements using Grid and Flex properties. This helped me to have a better understading of how these classes work and to keep the best size for each screen and device. I put into practice my skills and developed my own reusable function to fetch data from the API endpoint depending on the needs.

### Useful resources

- [Vite Documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/) - This is the Vite documentation page, which is what I used to develop this application. In there, I was able to gather and search all the information that I needed to succeed in this challenge.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - This is by far my preferred CSS framework to style my applications. I used the guide to enable the dark mode feature.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/home) - This is the tool I used to navigate through the different pages of my app. I found it very easy to use and implement and it contains some built-in methods, which simply getting access to some data.
